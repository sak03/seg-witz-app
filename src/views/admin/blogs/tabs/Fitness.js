                <p class="card-text lh-base">
                    With the start of the New Year, many of us have made
                    resolutions to improve our health and fitness. While
                    having specific health and fitness goals in mind is excellent, people often go to extremes to accomplish
                    these goals. They try the newest fad diet or workout trend and often end up exhausting both their mental
                    and physical energy.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text lh-base">This usually leads to either quitting altogether or reaching these goals and
                    being unable to maintain them, ultimately resulting in burnout, failure, or injury. Because of this,
                    I propose you ditch the extreme unrealistic goals and aim to change your lifestyle. </p>
                <p class="card-text lh-base">When you start to view health and fitness as a lifestyle rather than a part-time
                    hobby or 30-day challenge, you develop behaviors that will improve many areas of your life.</p>
                <p class="card-text lh-base">
                    Living a healthy lifestyle can inspire creativity and teach you discipline, adaptability, and balance.This
                    will not only leave you looking and feeling better, but you will show up as a better version of yourself for
                    the people in your life that truly matter.
                </p>
                <h1>IT’S MORE THAN AESTHETICS</h1>
                <p class="">Health and fitness are about more than the way</p>
                <p class="">you look, the food you eat, or the weight you lift at the gym. They’re about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the way you feel.</li>
                    <li>your quality of life.</li>
                    <li>the focus you have at work</li>
                    <li>your ability to move.</li>
                    <li>your psychological state.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="card-text lh-base">When you’re truly healthy, you are in a better mood and can physically do more. You can do things
                    like walking your dog, going hiking, or paddleboarding. Not being able to do these things
                    can drastically impact your experiences and limit your quality of life.</p>
                <h1>YOU LEARN EXACT BEHAVIOR CHANGE</h1>
                <p class="card-text lh-base">I find that “diets” or “workout challenges” only
                    last so long. It is unrealistic to be going at 100 MPH all the time. We are all
                    human. Life happens, stress comes and goes, and schedules can get thrown off.
                    When we choose to live a healthy lifestyle, we learn to accept these things and
                    ADAPT.</p>
                <p class="card-text lh-base">You learn to enjoy life when you are on vacation
                    and away from your gym and kitchen because you have developed the habits and
                    skills to live a healthy lifestyle no matter where you are. By always
                    practicing moderation and balance, you allow yourself to indulge without going
                    overboard. If you don't have access to a gym one week, you get in the habit of
                    traveling with your resistant bands, creating a bodyweight circuit, or using
                    nearby benches and stairs to get a workout in. You learn to adapt instead of
                    self-destructing when your routine gets thrown off. </p>
                <h1>CONSISTENCY</h1>
                <p class="card-text lh-base">Sure, people get results with extreme dieting or
                    partaking in workout challenges. However, the percentage of people who follow
                    those plans exactly is tiny. These challenges are often completed in a short
                    period and accompanied by strict guidelines of success and failure, both of
                    which are not good for your physical or emotional health.</p>
                <p class="card-text lh-base">
                    When you set extreme goals, you're more likely to
                    feel defeated if you "mess up." When the expectations aren't as intense,
                    you are more likely to stay consistent and enjoy your journey. You don't put
                    that pressure on yourself to be perfect. If you eat something “bad” or skip a
                    workout, you wake up the next day and get right back on track because now it’s
                    just part of your lifestyle. This approach is much more attainable and leads to
                    more consistency long term.
                </p>
                <h3>1. FIND EXERCISE YOU ENJOY</h3>
                <p class="card-text lh-base">
                    This is important when it comes to staying consistent with your workouts.
                    If you are continually doing exercises you don't enjoy, and they leave you
                    feeling drained physically and emotionally, it’s only going to last so long.
                    You are better off finding exercises that make you feel good, and you can stick
                    to long term, even if it's not the most intense. Consistent low-intensity exercise
                    will always triumph inconsistent high-intensity exercise.
                </p>
                <h3>2. BE PATIENT WHEN IT COMES TO REACHING YOUR PHYSICAL GOALS</h3>
                <p class="card-text lh-base">Remember, results take time. Be easy on yourself.
                    Nothing good comes easy. Learn to fall in love with the process and the person
                    you become throughout the journey.</p>
                <h3>3. DON’T GIVE UP THE FOODS YOU LOVE</h3>
                <p class="card-text lh-base">
                    I'm a firm believer in never giving up the foods
                    you love. Find a way to make your favorite foods healthier. If pizza is your
                    favorite food, don't give it up. This will leave you feeling deprived. Get
                    creative and use clean ingredients to make your healthy version.
                </p>
                <h3>4. DON’T COMPETE WITH ANYONE</h3>
                <p class="card-text lh-base">This is your life and your journey. No two people
                    are the same, so you should never compare yourself to others. As long as you
                    wake up every day and try to be better than you were yesterday, you are on the
                    right track.</p>
                <h3>5. TRY NEW THINGS</h3>
                <p class="card-text lh-base">
                    Step out of your comfort zone. Try a new fitness class with a friend and
                    explore different foods. Grocery shopping based on what's in season is an
                    easy way to begin experimenting with different foods and exposing yourself
                    to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. If you have never meal prepped
                    before, try it out! Stepping out of your comfort zone and switching things
                    up will keep things interesting and help you stay motivated and inspired to
                    make this way of living a permanent lifestyle.
