                            the world over. A sort of Indian pancake, dosas are made from a thin batter consisting of rice,
                            flour and lentils. Making dosas is no easy task, with the batter mixture having to soak in water
                            for at least 24 hours before it can be shaped. Once ready, the batter is ladled onto a hot tava
                            (griddle pan) and shaped in a similar way to how the French would shape a crepe. Traditionally,
                            dosas are served folded in half and stuffed with potatoes. Accompaniments like hot sambar give
                            the dish a spicy edge, and whatever you stuff them with, dosas are sure to provide a tasty yet
                            satisfying meal.

                        delicious savoury snacks. The name derives from three Hindi words meaning ‘a 
                        delicacy,’ ‘licking one’s fingers’ and ‘to devour with relish’ and this dish truly 
                        does live up to its heritage. Although there’s now a plethora of different varieties, 
                        the original chaat is a wonderful combination of diced potato pieces, crispy fried 
                        bread and chickpeas garnished with fresh coriander leaves, yoghurt and dried ginger 
                        and tamarind sauce. Make like a local and seek out a local dhaba, where the city’s 
                        specialist chaat variety will be available at nearly all times of day.
